# End-to-End-Real-Life-Project-with-Snowflake-Python-SQL-Power-BI
End-to-End Cloud DWBI Pipeline: Real-world data integration leveraging Snowflake, Python, and SQL. Features optimized ELT workflows, dimensional modeling, and Power BI dashboards for actionable insights. Demonstrates modern cloud data stack implementation for scalable analytics.

Project Workflow
1. ER Diagram Design
We map how data connects (like a treasure map) before building

2. Star/Snowflake Schemas
Organize data efficiently using special patterns for fast access

3. Python Test Data
Create fake-but-realistic data automatically for safe testing

4. Snowflake Setup
Prepare cloud storage (create digital "filing cabinets" for data)

5. Data Loading
Move processed data into Snowflake using Python scripts

6. SQL Queries
Ask smart questions to uncover insights from stored data

7. Report Planning
Blueprint dashboards to highlight key business stories

8. Power BI Dashboards
Build interactive visuals that update with live data
